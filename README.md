# Java GIS-like System & GUI  with mTSP/VRP Solution



[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/xposionn/OOP-Ex2/)
Â© Written by Liad Cohen and Timor Sharabi.

OOP-Ex2, Ex3, Ex4 are 3 assignments we (Liad and Timor) were doing as part of homework tasks in the Java Object Oriented Course in Ariel University.


## The whole project represents a Geographic Information System (GIS) with an amazing GUI.

## Project Overview 
Named "Pacman and Fruits" as assignment asked, but this can be used as a real-life GIS including a GUI with real-time Elements/Objects moving according to real-life speeds, 3D distances, Lat-Lon-Alt GPS coordinates converters and more.
Saving, Loading CSV files to work inside the application, as well as Exporting to KML files which are compatible with Google Earth, as well as showing the full animation of objects moving in the Java GUI (using threads), AND in Google Earth itself!
Algorithms to solve mTSP/VRP problems as all "Pacmen" will have to eat all "Fruits" as fast as possible (different speeds).

## Showcase

## EX2 - Release 2.0 (Basic Infrastructure)
We developed a GIS (Geographic Information System)-like system including GIS infrastructure, calculating real-life 3D distances between objects using our Lat-Lon-Alt coordinates converters, time changes between Long Epoch time to UTC, 
Reading CSV files & reading whole folders with CSV files, constructing objects from CSV and showing on Google Earth after exporting to KML files. 
(No GUI in this Release).


## EX3 - Release 3.0 (Full Project)
Java GUI including image map for a "game", real-life speeds of objects in a map, as well as real-life distances between pixels in a map, movement (with real-life speed) of elements and some algorithms to solve the mTSP "Pac-men on a map to eat all fruits as fast as possible". (with different speeds variant of the problem!).
Includes a "Painter" thread which will show an animation of the solved solution of the algorithm, moving the pac-men in real-time according to their speed (With respect to real-life distances). This thread will paint according to the user preferred FPS, and for how long he wants the animation to show.  Look here for more information.

This release includes "Path", "Solution" and "ShortestPathAlgo", "Game", "Map" "Fruits", "Packman" (Yes, with a typo because of the assignment), "GUI" classes and more.

## Algorithms Explanation
We use heuristics algorithms to solve the mTSP / VRP problem (With different speeds variant of the problem).
Using a min-heap (priority queue) with a comperator we agreed on, we then do run this simple algorithm:

Before each run, we check if a fruit is inside any 'eating radius' of some pacman. We then immediately can add this fruit for the pacman Path Solution as it does not add any time for the complete solution.
````Java
Solution solution = new Solution(packmen,currentTimeStamp);  
Iterator<Packman> packmanIterator = packmen.iterator();  
while (packmanIterator.hasNext()) {  
    Packman p = packmanIterator.next();  
  Iterator<Fruit> fruitIterator = fruits.iterator();  
 while (fruitIterator.hasNext()) {  
        Fruit f = fruitIterator.next();  
 if (p.distancePointFromEatRadius((Point3D) f.getGeom()) == 0) {  
            solution.getPath(p.getID()).addFruitToPath(f);  
  fruitIterator.remove();  
  }  
    }  
}
````
We then run through all the remaining fruits:
````Java
while (!fruits.isEmpty()) {  
    Packman p = packmen.poll();  
 double min = Double.MAX_VALUE;  
  Fruit eatMe = null;  
  Iterator<Fruit> itFruit = this.fruits.iterator();  
 while (itFruit.hasNext()) {  
        Fruit f = itFruit.next();  
 double timeToEat = p.distancePointFromEatRadius((Point3D) f.getGeom()) / p.getSpeed();  
 if (timeToEat < min) {  
            eatMe = f;  
  min = timeToEat;  
  }  
    }  
    p.addTimeTraveled(min);  
 double ratio = p.distancePointFromEatRadius((Point3D) eatMe.getGeom()) / coords.distance3d((Point3D) p.getGeom(), (Point3D) eatMe.getGeom());  
  Point3D vectorBetween = coords.vector3D((Point3D) p.getGeom(), (Point3D) eatMe.getGeom());  
  p.setGeom(coords.add((Point3D) p.getGeom(), new Point3D(vectorBetween.x() * ratio, vectorBetween.y() * ratio, vectorBetween.z() * ratio))); //packman will be placed at the next fruit position that he will eat.  
  solution.getPath(p.getID()).addFruitToPath(eatMe);  
  fruits.remove(eatMe);  
  packmen.add(p);  
}
````
